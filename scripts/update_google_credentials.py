ðŸ”§ Google Cloud Console Credentials Update Required
==================================================

The OAuth flow has been updated to use localhost redirect instead of the deprecated OOB flow.
You need to update your Google Cloud Console credentials to support this.

ðŸ“‹ Steps to Update Credentials:

1. Go to Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Select your project
3. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
4. Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID (the one you're using)
5. Click on it to edit
6. In the "Authorized redirect URIs" section, add:
   http://localhost:8080
7. Save the changes

ðŸ“‹ Alternative: Create New Credentials

If you prefer to create new credentials:

1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
3. Choose "Desktop application"
4. Give it a name (e.g., "Media Pipeline Sync Checker Localhost")
5. In "Authorized redirect URIs", add:
   http://localhost:8080
6. Click "Create"
7. Download the JSON file and update your credentials file

ðŸ“‹ Update Credentials File

After updating the credentials in Google Cloud Console, update your local credentials file:

/opt/media-pipeline/config/google_photos_credentials.json

Make sure it contains:
{
  "client_id": "your_new_client_id.apps.googleusercontent.com",
  "client_secret": "your_new_client_secret"
}

ðŸ“‹ Then Run Authentication

After updating the credentials, run:
python3 scripts/google_photos_auth_localhost.py

This will use the new localhost redirect method instead of the deprecated OOB flow.
