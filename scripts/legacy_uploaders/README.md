# Legacy iCloud Uploaders

These scripts capture historical experiments with Selenium, early Puppeteer prototypes, and Python shims. They are preserved for reference only and are no longer maintained.

Use `scripts/upload_icloud.js` for all production automation. Refer to the top-level README for configuration, selector overrides, and session persistence guidance.
